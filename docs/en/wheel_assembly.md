### Controller
<img src="../../assets/images/mks_xdrive_single.jpg" width="360">

I've selected **MKS XDrive** just because it has good square shape, square pattern of mounting holes, 
and comes in a bundle with the braking resistor and wires. 

{: .important }
> For other options check the page with [**supported controllers**](hardware_controller.html) 

### Motor
<img src="../../assets/images/motor65.jpg" width="360">

Obviously - 6.5 inch howerboard motor. Cheap and powerfull. 

{: .important }
> Why? You will find the answer in the chapter about [**supported motors**](hardware_motor.html)

### Encoder
<img src="../../assets/images/mt6701.jpg" width="360">

MT6701. Just the cheapest option for the purpose of the cheapest build!

{: .important }
> Alternative [**encoders**](hardware_encoder.html) available and can be used.

### Mount
Six of SK16 and single 16mm diameter shaft...

<img src="../../assets/images/sk16.jpg" width="360">
<img src="../../assets/images/shaft.jpg" width="360">

...are enough to build robust, stiff and adjustable mount!

{: .important }
>Search by keywords "linear shaft holder", "linear shaft", "hollow linear shaft" on Aliexpress. 100mm or 150mm length will do the job.  

### Breakout PCB
<img src="https://image.easyeda.com/pullimage/9bFOfLqxbGjtUzj0FQzwNo2eqDirP2PWxx8lDwoS.jpeg" width="360">

[Publicly available on Easyeda](https://u.easyeda.com/olukelo/ffb-breakout).
JLCPCB.COM will make it for you as cheap as 2$ for 5 pcs. It helps to arrange everything and make a "clean" build because was designed to perfectly couple enclosure with mounting hardware.

### Wheel attachment
<img src="../../assets/images/spacer.jpg" width="360">

As I do not need to swap the wheel - solid one works for me. In case you need swap wheels - just select quick release.

{: .important }
> Searching for "Steering Wheel Hub Spacer" and "Steering Wheel Quick Release" on Aliexpress gives plenty of good results.

### Enclosure
Designed specifically for **MKS XDrive** and **MT6701**. For other options need some mixing and matching.

{: .important }
> [**Check the link**](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/howerboard-dd-ffb-wheel-enclosure) with STL files ready to be printed, and full STEP project in case you would like to modify it for your need.
