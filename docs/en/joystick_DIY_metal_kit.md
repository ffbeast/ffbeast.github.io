For those who do not want to bother with searching places where to order metal parts and source other major parts separately I can propose a kits of them. 

{: .important }
>All parts are as they come from machining shop. You will need to deburr/sand them on your own if needed.

{: .important }
>Kit will include only parts on photo. You will need to obtain screws/nuts and electronic on your own according to the BOM.
