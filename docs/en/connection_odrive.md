# Intro

Connection principles are common for all types of devices. No mater it is a wheel or joystick or rudder pedals. 
Schematic is identical. Exact location of specific pins vary depending on the actual board.  

## Warning!

{: .warning }
> **NEWER, EVER, TRUST WIRE COLOR CODING!**
> 
> Check name of the pin or wire coming from encoder and **ALWAYS** connect by the name, not by the color of the wire. 
> There is no standard wiring color coding and each manufacturer can change the color of the wire without any notice.
> Match connections **BY THE NAME!**

# Required connections

## ODESC 4.2 (Single axis)

## MKS XDRIVE MINI (Single axis)

## ODrive/XDrive (Dual axis) 

{: .important }
>Keep order of encoders and motors!

>Both axis need to be connected as on the picture! **Pitch** to **M1** and **Roll** to **M0**

# Optional connections

## Connecting additional axes (Analog sensors)

FFBeast firmware supports up to 3 additional analog sensors connected. Signal line must be connected to GPIO 1, 2 or 3. 
Locate corresponding pins depending on your exact board. 

Use any of GND pin and power according to sensor datasheet (either 3.3V or 5V).

{: .important }
>**Analog** mode need to be selected for corresponding GPIO in configurator in order to activate functionality!  

{: .important }
>STM32 controllers can read on analog input only range 0V - 3.3V. In case you use 5V sensor make sure that active range
>of it is the supported range. Signal values over 3.3V will be just clipped to 3.3V!   

## Connecting buttons

FFBeast firmware supports up to 8 separate buttons connected. Signal line must be connected to GPIO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.
Locate corresponding pins depending on your exact board.

{: .important }
>**Generic button** mode need to be selected for corresponding GPIO in configurator in order to activate functionality!

{: .important }
>As in button mode GPIO pins are pulled up internally, use GND pin as second side connection of your button!

If you need to connect more then 8 buttons, or your board do not have 
enough pins (ODESC, XDDRIVE MINI, XDRIVE-S do not have all gpio pins routed to connectors) consider using SPI extensions.

## Connecting SPI extensions

FFBeast firmware supports connecting additional SPI extensions.
Unfortunately shift registers in most cases actively drive MISO line and interfere with driver initialization. 
We can not connect it just to exposed on board SPI pins without proper tristate buffers. 
So to make things easier for SPI purpose we need to use normal GPIO pins as standard nCS, SCK and MISO lines.    

{: .important }
>In ODrive/XDrive schematic only pins 3,4,and 5 do not have additional filtering so those lines are recommended for connecting SPI extensions.

{: .important }
>One of SPI extension modes must be selected and proper SPI GPIO pins assigned in configurator in order to activate functionality! 


### 3xCD4021

This configuration is used in most of Thrustmaster wheel extensions. So use it when you want to connect TM wheel or have 
DIY shift registers board from mentioned shift registers.

[<img src="../../assets/images/wiring/tm_wheel.jpg" width="360">](../../assets/images/wiring/tm_wheel.jpg)

**Recommended connection:**
- Connect **GND** line of extension to **GND** on ODrive.
- Connect **MISO** line of extension to **GPIO 4** on ODrive.
- Connect **SCK** line of extension to **GPIO 3** on ODrive.
- Connect **nCS** line of extension to **GPIO 5** on ODrive (See comment below).
- Connect **VCC** line of extension to **3.3V** on ODrive.

**Recommended configuration on GPIO tab:**
- Set SPI extension mode to **3xCD4201**.
- Set GPIO mode for **Pin 3** to **SCK**.
- Set GPIO mode for **Pin 4** to **MISO**.
- Set GPIO mode for **Pin 5** to **nCS** (See comment below).

**Recommended configuration on Buttons tab:**
- Set **Button mode** for all buttons in **Shift register** groups to **Normal**.

{: .important }
> Some boards do not have  Pin 5 exposed on board. In that case use **any free GPIO** pin for connecting **nCS** line. 
> Remember to set **nCS** mode for corresponding pin you in configurator!    

{: .warning }
> [**Always keep the disclaimer in mind**](#warning)**!**


### 3xSN74hc165

There is support of extension board that you can purchase on Aliexpress.

[<img src="../../assets/images/wiring/sn74HC165.jpg" width="360">](../../assets/images/wiring/sn74HC165.jpg)

{: .important }
>Marking on those boards is wrong! 
> **OUT** side is for connecting other boards in chain. 
> **IN** side is for connecting to microcontroller.  Connect **IN** side to the **ODrive**!

**Recommended connection:**
- Connect **GND** line of extension to **GND** on ODrive.
- Connect **MISO** line of extension to **GPIO 4** on ODrive.

- Connect **nCS** line of extension to **GPIO 5** on ODrive (See comment below).
- Connect **5V** line of extension to **3.3V** on ODrive (_Despite what is written on board it works better with 3.3V power_).

**Recommended configuration on GPIO tab:**
- Set SPI extension mode to **3xSN74hc165**.
