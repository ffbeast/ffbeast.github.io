## Supported encoder types

At present, the firmware exclusively supports **incremental types of encoders**. 
Theoretically, any incremental encoder should be compatible, whether optical, magnetic, or another type, 
as long as it outputs A/B impulses

{: .important }
> The **Z index is not utilized**, so it is not critical whether the encoder has it or not.

## What is PPR/CPR?

**PPR** - Pulses per rotation: Indicates the number of pulses generated by each channel (A or B) 
for one full rotation of the encoder.

**CPR** - Counts per rotation: Indicates the number of position counts that can be calculated 
from the encoder by combining the pulses from both channels (A and B).

Relation: **CPR = 4 x PPR**

> PPR (Pulses Per Revolution) in the datasheet for your encoder, simply multiply it by 4 to obtain the equivalent CPR.

## CPR requirements?
In general, the firmware is designed to work with any encoder. 
However, for optimal performance in tandem **with a hoverboard motor**, 
I recommend using an encoder with **1000 CPR or higher** when directly connected to the motor shaft **without reduction**. 
If the encoder is connected with a reducer, an encoder with lower resolution can be used.

## Recommendations on purchase 

There are numerous encoders available on the market. Some have already been tested and are guaranteed to work. 
However, no direct links will be provided as they tend to become outdated quickly. 
Just use a search engine for the most up-to-date options.

### CUI - AMT 10x series
<img src="../../assets/images/AMT10x.png">

The most expensive yet highly reliable option available comes in a very compact form, and it is represented by several options:

- AMT-102 (8192 CPR)
- AMT-103 (8192 CPR)
- **AMT-10E2 (20480 CPR)**
- **AMT-10E3 (20480 CPR)**

I prefer last two options for my devices. As them cost the same as first two, but have higher CPR.

### OMRON-style
<img src="../../assets/images/omron.jpg">

Countless variants are there. All of them are "clones" of OMRON encoder. Different CPR available. Just some model are:
- E6B2-CWZ5B
- E6C2-CWZ6C
- 38S6G5-B-G24N
- E6B2-CWZ1X
- YT06
- etc...

### Magnetic encoders
<img src="../../assets/images/magnetic.png">

This group operates on a common principle. 
Typically, it consists of a PCB with a small chip. To ensure proper functionality, 
a magnet must be carefully placed and centered on the motor shaft. 
The PCB should be precisely positioned along the axis of rotation of the magnet.
While it is the most economical option, mounting requires creativity as there is no standard solution. 
Here are some recommended options from this group:

- MT6701 (4096 CPR)
- MT6825 (16384 CPR)
