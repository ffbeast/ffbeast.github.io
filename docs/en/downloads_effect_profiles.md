## Disclaimer

{: .warning }
> As each and every FFBEast base is unique because can be built with different components (motors, controllers) and
> with different mechanical scheme, profiles created on one device can cause high forces, excessive dampening or oscillations on another device. 
> In that case some tuning of effects (usually spring forces and smart dampening) could be needed for your specific FFB base.    

{: .important }
> All profiles there are in JSON format, and often browser treat it as normal document and opens in a new page. Use **"
> Right Click"** and **"Save As"** approach for downloading it.

> Put downloaded JSON file to the _effect_profiles_ folder to be visible by Commander.

# Templates

Generic templates are not bound to some specific game. It's just baseline and mimics "average" behaviour of flight controls.
By removing non relevant effects and/or changing type of a main spring effect it is possible to adjust 
templates to the most modules present in games.

- [**Generic jet template**](../../assets/profiles/GENERIC___Jet_template___mix_of_DirectX_and_relevant_telemetry_shakers.json) **(by FFBeast)**
  - Stick only
  - Includes relevant shakers
  - Includes hardware trim effect

- [**Generic prop airplane template**](../../assets/profiles/GENERIC___Prop_airplane_template___mix_of_DirectX_and_relevant_telemetry_shakers.json) **(by FFBeast)**
  - Stick only
  - Includes relevant shakers
  - Includes hardware trim effect

- [**DirectX based helos template**](../../assets/profiles/GENERIC___Helos_template___mix_of_DirectX_with_dampening_and_shakers.json) **(by FFBeast)**
  - Stick only
  - Includes relevant shakers
  - Includes hardware trim effect
  - DirectX effect as the main source of force and relies completely on implementation of FFB in game.

- [**Generic helos template**](../../assets/profiles/GENERIC___Helos_template___mix_of_light_spring_with_dampening_and_shakers.json) **(by FFBeast)**
  - Stick only
  - Includes relevant shakers
  - Includes hardware trim effect
  - This profile uses simple spring as the main source of force and independent from DirectX FFB implementation
