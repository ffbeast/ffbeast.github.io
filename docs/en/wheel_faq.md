## How to get a Serial Key?

First. It is **not mandatory** to have a **Serial Key** to activate controller as the Wheel.
It could be activated without it.
Just keep **Serial Key** fields as it is and press **Activate**. 
Wheel will be activated in **standard mode** which have all essential settings. **90%** of cases could be covered by **standard mode**. 

Serial key is needed only for **extended mode**, which allows to change some **non critical** settings and connect 
additional buttons/axis directly to ODrive. So it is mandatory only for **more complex builds**.

## I want to have extended version. How?

Consider to become a supporter by [**donating**](shop_wheel_license.html) on project development.

Extended functionality comes with extended responsibilities :)
